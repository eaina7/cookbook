      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Heat sauce and hold for assembly.</li>
        <li>Heat meatballs and slice then hold for assembly.</li>
        <li>
          In a very large wide pot, heat water and once boiling, salt the water
          then add one lasagna strip at a time so that they don’t stick. Cook
          for one minute short of what it says on the box. My box said to cook
          for eight minutes and I cooked for seven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a strainer standing by and gently lift each piece out with tongs
          and into the strainer, being careful not to break any. Rinse with cold
          running water and lay out on a sheet tray with the pieces not
          touching. I layered with plastic wrap until I was ready to use them.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, egg,
          salt, pepper, nutmeg and ½ cup of the mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>
          To assemble, in a 9×13-inch or larger* casserole dish place one cup of
          sauce on the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>Lay four lasagna noodles the long way, overlapping each.</li>
        <li>
          Lay half of the sliced meatballs across the noodles, overlapping if
          needed to fit. Cover with ½ cup of sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lay five slices of provolone over the meatballs, cutting one piece in
          half to fit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top with another layer of noodles, then cover with all of the ricotta
          mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place another layer of noodles over the ricotta and top with the
          remaining meatballs and another ½ cup of sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the remaining provolone over the meatballs and top with a final
          layer of noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the top with one cup of sauce then sprinkle the remaining
          shredded mozzarella over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover with parchment and foil and bake for 45 minutes. (You may need a
          sheet of foil on the rack below to catch drips.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Uncover and bake for five more minutes. If desired, place under
          broiler for a few minutes to brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let sit ten minutes then cut 4×3 (thirds across the short edge of the
          pan and quarters across the long edge) to yield 12 portions. Serve
          with additional sauce.
        </li>
